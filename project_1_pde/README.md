# Compilation and Execution Instructions

The code in this project is written in a way that is very sensitive to the directory from which compilation and execution commands are run from the shell.

Instructions:

1. `cd` into the `Project_1_pde` directory.
2. If you want to compile the source, make sure to output (g++ `-o`) the executable in the provided `obj` directory, otherwise this step can be skipped.
