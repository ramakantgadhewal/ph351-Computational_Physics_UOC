## Introduction

Molecular Dynamics is a computational method for simulating the complex dynamics between molecules in lattices. Under MD we assume that particles behave according to Newtonian mechanics (although Hamiltonian mechanics can be used). It is usually applied in the examination of thermodynamic variables.

## Method

In this section we will shortly examine the iterative process that is MD.
